# Car-Service-Project
Hello people. 
This is a car service Web Application that lets you add cars to your database. We can specify the model type of the car and the faulty parts. The application can provide you 
with the cost of repairs. Also it can generate a list of repairs a customer has made so that you can keep a check. This application is based on MVC architecture.
Spring MVC with hibernate and Data JPA is used. For front end, JSP pages are used.
